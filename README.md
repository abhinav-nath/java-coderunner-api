# Java CodeRunner API

This is a small Spring Boot app that exposes a REST API which can take Java code as request payload and execute it.

Start the app by running `Application` class.

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/execute` with payload:

```java
public class TempCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

Your code will be executed and output will be printed to your console:

You can even execute fairly complex code like:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class TempCode {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      String city = "Pune";
      String urlString = "https://wttr.in/" + city + "?format=%l+weather+:+%C+%c+|+Temperature+%t+|+Feels+like+%f+|+Humidity+%h+|+Moon+phase+%m+|+Sunrise+%S+|+Sunset+%s\n";

      URL url = new URL(urlString);
      HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
      connection.setRequestMethod("GET");

      BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
      String inputLine;
      StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder();
      while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
        content.append(inputLine);
      }
      in.close();
      connection.disconnect();

      // Print the weather data
      System.out.println("Weather Data: " + content.toString());
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

The possibilities are endless! üòâ
