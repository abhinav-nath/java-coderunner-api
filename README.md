# Java CodeRunner API

This is a small Spring Boot app that exposes a REST API which can take Java code as request payload and execute it.

Start the app by running `Application` class.

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/execute` with payload:

```java
public class TempCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Your code will be executed and output will be printed to your console:
